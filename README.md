## Description

Inspired by a childhood pastime of mine, done with paper and pencil. Name your team then watch them climb the ranks or plummet to last place. Generate random results with random players and random stats. 

Teams and players that start off lucky gain skill points, increasing the likelihood of future luck. The luckier a team or player is, the more they have to lose against the unluckier teams. The opposite logic applies as well. 

## Features

* Stats leaderboard for every player on every team (hits, home runs, steals, etc.), including the ability to sort by highest in each category
* Playoffs and special playoff bracket presentation
* Match reports with a play-by-play breakdown of each game 
* The ability to animate a game (or match report) on a 2D field. Speed it up or slow it down to your liking!

## Built With

* HTML, CSS, and some good ol' fashion JavaScript

## Author

* **Jade Del Rosario-Bell** (https://github.com/jadedrb/)
